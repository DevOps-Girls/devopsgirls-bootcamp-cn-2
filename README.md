# SEEK & DevOps Girls Bootcamp

DevOps Girls with the massive support from SEEK are hosting a day-long bootcamp
to explore all things Serverless!

If you're looking to be buzzword compliant, 'serverless' is on that list. We
wanted to create an opportunity for people to learn about the technical concepts
and get hands-on exposure in a super supportive and encouraging environment.

This is a one day bootcamp, that will introduce participants to AWS, Lambda,
event-driven architecture, infrastructure as code, static website hosting,
Serverless Framework.

Programming knowledge is helpful, but not required - code will be provided for
you. Basic command line skills would be very helpful and we would recommend
completing a short code academy course on using the command line - (See
Resources below)

Throughout the day, participants will first be introduced to concepts at a high
level. Then you will get to practise yourself. We will start from deploying a
simple website that will have some todos (classic!) and gradually move to more
complex things, like an event that will be triggered when a todo is overdue,
added, edited or removed.

What will you expect from the day? You'll have a team of supportive people from
our industry dedicating their Saturday to your learning and development.

You'll be able to learn in a multi-modal format, including hands on and you'll
have access to all the learning materials.

Things you'll need:

- a laptop! (but if this is not possible, send us a message)
- an AWS account - (See Resources below)
