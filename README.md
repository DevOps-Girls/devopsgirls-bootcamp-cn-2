# The second DevOps Girls bootcamp in Xi'an, China

DevOps Girls is hosting a day-long bootcamp to explore all things Serverless 
in Thoughtworks Xi'an office!

This material is heavily based on [SEEK & DevOps Girls Bootcamp](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/DevOps-Girls-Bootcamp-4).

If you're looking to be buzzword compliant, 'serverless' is on that list. We
wanted to create an opportunity for people to learn about the technical concepts
and get hands-on exposure in a super supportive and encouraging environment.

This is a one day bootcamp, that will introduce participants to AWS, Lambda,
event-driven architecture, infrastructure as code, static website hosting,
Serverless Framework.

Programming knowledge is helpful, but not required - code will be provided for
you. Basic command line skills would be very helpful and we would recommend
completing a short code academy course on using the command line - (See
Resources below)

Throughout the day, participants will first be introduced to concepts at a high
level. Then you will get to practise yourself. We will start from deploying a
simple website that will have some todos (classic!) and gradually move to more
complex things, like an event that will be triggered when a todo is overdue,
added, edited or removed.

What will you expect from the day? You'll have a team of supportive people from
our industry dedicating their Saturday to your learning and development.

You'll be able to learn in a multi-modal format, including hands on and you'll
have access to all the learning materials.

Things you'll need:

- a laptop!
